<p>Making my development workflow as fast as possible is a big passion of mine. From customizing my
development setup to get the last inkling of efficiency out of it, to thinking how to manage notes
and knowledge resources to access them as quickly as possible. With the sudden ubiquity of AI in
development tools, I came to wonder how AI could help me write code faster. Being quite the skeptic
when it comes to AI actually generating code for me (using tools such as Cursor or GitHub Copilot),
I came to investigate AI agents which specialise in code reviews. In this blog post I will share my
experience using such an agent on a real world case. I will explore where such agents shine and
where they are severely lacking.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="i-am-an-ai-skeptic">I am an AI Skeptic</h1>
<p>Generally I am not fond of using AI to develop software. My background is mostly in systems
software, where correctness of the software can be critical. This means that using tooling that is
non-deterministic and might not produce adequate results makes me uneasy. Furthermore, even if AI
were to produce amazing results, a developer relying on it could quickly lose understanding of the
code. This results in skill atrophy and large risks if the AI reaches the limits of its
capabilities. In other words, I am not keen on having any AI generating code for me on a large scale
for anything more than a proof of concept or low risk project.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, one would be foolish to ignore AI's capabilities when it comes to developer tooling.</p>
<h1 id="ai-support-agents">AI Support Agents</h1>
<p>Thus starts my journey investigating AI agents that can support me in the software development
lifecycle, but whose main use is <em>not</em> to generate code. Many such agents exist, mostly focusing on
reviewing code. I am quite the fan of such a use case, as the AI essentially plays the role of
another developer I might work with. It reviews my code, provides feedback, suggestions, and
potentially even improvements. It however does this immediately after I have opened a pull request,
rather than having to wait for days or weeks on a human review.</p>
<p>How is this different from using an AI that generates code you might ask? The main difference lies
in the fact that I still have to think on how to solve the problem I am working on, and provide a
base solution. This forces me to understand the issue at hand. Thus, I am much better prepared to
accept or reject any suggestions from an AI than if the AI just generated a first solution for me.
Moreover, people (myself included) tend to be slightly defensive about the code they write. Thus I
will, in all likelihood, only accept AI generated code improvements if it offers a real improvement,
rather than blindly incorporating them into the codebase.</p>
<p>All in all, it is extremely unlikely that I will lose understanding of the codebase or have my
problem solving skills atrophy, but I can iterate on reviews much faster.</p>
<h1 id="coderabbitai">CodeRabbitAI</h1>
<p>In order to gain first experiences with such an AI agent, I chose to try out
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://www.coderabbit.ai/">CodeRabbitAI</a>. This was not a thoroughly researched decision. The main
reason I chose CodeRabbitAI is that I could try it out for free during 14 days and that it
integrates well with GitHub. I am aware that performance between AI models varies greatly. However,
CodeRabbitAI uses Claude under the hood, a model typically known to perform surprising well on
programming tasks. I thus expect it to not perform significantly worse than any other state of the
art model out there.</p>
<h1 id="starting-small">Starting Small</h1>
<p>In my opinion, such agents need to be tested on real world examples. One can see demos using AI to
generate a dummy web app all over the place. However, common software projects are significantly
larger, contain more complex logic, and are less standardized than these demos. Unfortunately, most
software I work on professionally is not publicly available, so I cannot use CodeRabbitAI on these.
I therefore picked two (still very small) personal projects of mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/f4z3r/gruvbox-material.nvim">NeoVim plugin</a> providing a colour scheme.</li>
<li>A <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/f4z3r/sofa">command execution engine</a> to run templated commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both projects are extremely small, with under two thousand lines of code. Both projects are written
in Lua, a quite uncommon language. I wanted to see how the AI fares against something it is unlikely
to have seen too much during its training.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I wrote a
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/f4z3r/gruvbox-material.nvim/pull/40">first pull request</a> implementing a fix in
highlight groups for pop-up menus in NeoVim. I enabled CodeRabbitAI to summarize the PR for me.</p>

  
  
    
    
  
  <div class="zoomable-image-container">
    <img src="https://f4z3r.github.io/img/ai-agents/summary-first-pr-0.png" alt="Summary provided by CodeRabbitAI on my first PR" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
  </div>

<p>The summary looks good, even though it somehow marks some fixes as features. This is especially
intriguing as I use <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">conventional commits</a> and
explicitly marked these changes as fixes. Additionally, CodeRabbitAI offers a "walkthrough" of the
changes made in the PR. In the case of such a simple PR, I found the walkthrough to be mostly
confusing. In the case of larger PRs I can however see how this may be appealing.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/ai-agents/walkthrough-first-pr.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    
      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>A walkthrough of the changes in the first PR</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>In reality, I initially opened the PR with only the fixes the pop-up menus. I then pushed commits
introducing the support for additional plugins later on. I would have expected CodeRabbitAI to
complain that the new commits introduce changes unrelated to the PR, which is not seen as best
practice. It did nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>While the summary, walkthrough, and disregard for best practices were unsatisfying, one unexpected
benefit emerged: the integration of linting feedback directly within the pull request comments. It
provided nitpicks from linting tools (in this case
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint"><code>markdownlint</code></a>. On one side, it is very disappointing
to see that the AI agent did nothing more than lint the code and generate a nice comment out of the
output. On the other hand it is quite nice that it introduces "quality gates" such as linting
without me having to write a pipeline for it. Moreover, producing easily digestible output from a
linter is nothing to be underestimated. The quality of life of having this directly as a comment
rather than having to go through pipeline logs to read the raw linter output is quite nice. Is it
worth two dozen USD per month? No, definitely not!</p>
<p>On the upside, it did update the summary of the PR to reflect the other changes:</p>

  
  
    
    
  
  <div class="zoomable-image-container">
    <img src="https://f4z3r.github.io/img/ai-agents/summary-first-pr-1.png" alt="Updated summary provided by CodeRabbitAI on my first PR" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
  </div>

<p>The first PR was extremely trivial. It did not introduce any code containing logic. Other than not
pointing out that it should probably have been two separate PRs, CodeRabbitAI fared as I would have
expected another developer to have reviewed the PR. With two small differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CodeRabbitAI review was close to <strong>immediate</strong> (took around 30-60 seconds to run). This is
amazing to iterate quickly.</li>
<li>Where I would have expected a human reviewer to point our the nitpick or simply approve,
CodeRabbitAI is extremely <strong>verbose</strong> with explanations, walkthroughs, and so on. This in turn
wastes time for the author, as he/she would need to read through this. The verbosity could be
nicer on larger PRs, but for small concise PRs this is massive overkill and borderline annoying.</li>
</ul>
<p>To further evaluate CodeRabbitAI's capabilities, I decided to test it on a pull request with more
substantial changes...</p>
<h1 id="a-more-complex-pr">A More Complex PR</h1>
<p>Armed with dampened expectations from my first PR, I opened
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/f4z3r/sofa/pull/3">another PR</a> in the command execution repository implementing
a feature affecting multiple files. These changes also update existing logic.</p>
<p>In this second PR, CodeRabbitAI went above and beyond, and generated a walkthrough containing two
sequence diagrams showcasing the control flow of the code that was modified! I was actually quite
impressed by this. While probably not necessary for the author of a PR, this is great even only for
documentation purposes. New team members with less experience may benefit from such visual aids to
understand complex logic within the code. Unfortunately the diagrams didn't highlight the <em>specific
modifications</em> introduced by the pull request.</p>
<p>However, the supporting text suddenly becomes more relevant when considering such PRs.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/ai-agents/sequence-diagram.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    
      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>One of the sequence diagrams generated by CodeRabbitAI</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>On top of that, CodeRabbitAI actually posted interesting comments. It found the odd nitpick here and
there, but also found more meaningful potential issues. For instance, I modified a test
configuration to use a different shell. CodeRabbitAI identified that this shell is not listed as a
dependency anywhere in the repository, and that it would thus not work off-the-shelf. In this case
this was only a test file used to parse the configuration and the configured shell did not affect
anything, but this is a great finding generally.</p>
<p>I also started conversing with CodeRabbitAI about some changes. Requesting it to give me a
suggestion on some configurations. It managed just fine, but did not actually provide these as code
suggestions that can be applied, but rather as code blocks in comments, which was a bit
disappointing.</p>
<p>Additionally, I decided to try to use CodeRabbitAI's commands feature. This enables ChatOps to
control actions taken by CodeRabbitAI. I generated the PR title using one such command. The title
turned out generic and not very informative. In CodeRabbitAI's defense, I am quite unsure how I
would have named that PR.</p>
<p>I then tried to get it to write docstrings for new functions that were introduced in the PR. It
massively misunderstood the request, and created
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/f4z3r/sofa/pull/4">a PR adding docstrings to all functions</a> in the affected
files, even ones that already had docstrings... This goes to show that in some cases, it cannot even
do what the most junior of all engineers would be capable of doing thanks to a even so tiny dose of
common sense. Moreover, it started adding commits with emojis in the title. This goes to show that
these AIs are probably not trained much on professional projects.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/ai-agents/coderabbitai-commit-emoji.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    
      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>CodeRabbitAI not only breaking conventional commits but introducing emojis...</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>After that first disaster, with significantly less ambition, I requested it creates a PR to change a
small typo. CodeRabbitAI informed me that it created a branch with the changes included, but that it
was not capable of creating pull requests. This shocked me, considering it had created its first
disaster PR no 10 minutes before.</p>

  
  
    
    
  
  <div class="zoomable-image-container">
    <img src="https://f4z3r.github.io/img/ai-agents/correct-typo-second-pr.png" alt="Fighting with CodeRabbitAI to fix my typo." class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
  </div>

<p>After another nudge, CodeRabbitAI however did <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/f4z3r/sofa/pull/5">create a PR</a>.
It targeted <code>main</code> instead of the branch I was initially using. I guess this is my own fault though
for not being specific enough.</p>
<p>Finally, I also tried to get it to update the wording on a commit it did to use conventional
commits. Unfortunately it seems that it only has access to the GitHub API and cannot execute any
local <code>git</code> commands. It is therefore not able to perform some relatively common operations in the
SDLC that are not part of the GitHub API. However, I am guessing this is subject to change
relatively soon with the emergence of technologies such as the
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">model context protocol</a>, which would enable it to
control external tools such as <code>git</code>.</p>
<p>All in all, I would say CodeRabbitAI did as I would have expected after the first PR. It corrected
nitpicks and allowed me to perform some simple actions. Did it deliver a review of the same quality
like a senior engineer familiar with the project would have? No. In fact, in order to test this I
intentionally implemented a feature that was already present in the repository, while making a
couple design decisions that go against most of what the rest of the repository does. CodeRabbitAI
neither detected that the logic I was introducing was already present in the codebase, nor did it
complain about the sub-optimal design decisions. This goes to show that such agents are still not
capable replacing humans with nuanced understanding of the project's history and architectural
principles, potentially leading to the introduction of redundant or suboptimal solutions.</p>
<h1 id="dashboards">Dashboards!</h1>
<p>Another feature of AI agents next to the reviews is the analytics capabilities that come with them.
In my personal opinion, analytics are important to measure the impact the introduction of such
tooling has on the software delivery. CodeRabbitAI provides a couple nice dashboards on how much it
is being used, and what kind of errors it helped uncover.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/ai-agents/activity-dashboard.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>

      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>Activity dashboard showing engagment with CodeRabbitAI</p>

  </figure>


  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/ai-agents/adoption-dashboard.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    
      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>Dashboard showing overall adoption of CodeRabbitAI on the projects</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/ai-agents/findings-dashboard.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    
      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>Findings dashboard showing errors and suggestions by type</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>I did not try out CodeRabbitAI for long enough to have any meaningful metrics, but I am confident
that the capabilities provided are enough to get a decent understanding of the quality of adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, CodeRabbitAI supports reporting. This allows to generate reports based on natural language
prompts that could be useful for product owners to get insights of changes made to the software over
the course of a sprint.</p>
<h1 id="verdict">Verdict</h1>
<p>While this whole article might seem like a slight rant against such tools, I would in fact wish I
could use such tools at work. Not as a replacement for human reviewers, but as an addition to them.
For instance, the quite verbose walkthroughs CodeRabbitAI provides can be a very helpful entrypoint
to a human reviewer on larger PRs. Moreover, while the quality of the review is insufficient for
projects where quality matters, having near instant feedback is amazing.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned above, I believe one major selling point of such agents is in the way we
humans interact with them. Even if the agent might do little more than execute linters or similar in
the background, having the output of these tools in natural language directly as comments in the PRs
is not to be underestimated. This is especially true in the age where more and more responsibility
is being shifted to developers. With DevSecOps, developers have to understand and act upon the
output of all kinds of tools. Presenting this output in a more understandable format, potentially
enriched with explanations, can have a significant impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a final word, I would actually encourage people to explore such agents to augment
their workflow <strong>safely</strong>, albeit with caution and a clear understanding of their <strong>limitations</strong>.</p>
