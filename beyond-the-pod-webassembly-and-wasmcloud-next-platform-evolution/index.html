<p>Over the past few months I have invested some time to contribute to an open source project I find
fascinating: <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://wasmcloud.com/">wasmCloud</a>. As a platform engineer and architect, I am very
familiar with how software platforms are typically built in practice. However, with the ubiquity of
Kubernetes, you run the risk to being stuck in the "doing it the Kubernetes way" line of thinking.
But then again, are there any better ways? This is where wasmCloud caught my attention. A modern
platform building on proven concepts from Kubernetes, but with some significant differences. In this
article I want to introduce wasmCloud, how it compares to Kubernetes, what its internal architecture
looks like, and what ideas are, in my humble opinion, a step up from "the Kubernetes way of things".</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Before getting started, I need to get some things out of the way. This article will make quite a few
comparisons to Kubernetes and bytecode interpreters like the JVM. If you are unfamiliar with these
technologies, it might make sense to have a short look at what these are. Considering you clicked on
this article, I am however guessing that you are familiar with them and have some experience in
platform engineering practices, either as a poweruser of a platform, or as a designer and developer
of one.</p>
<p>Moreover, I want to thank the company I work for, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://ipt.ch/en/">ipt</a>, for allowing me to
invest time to learn about new technologies such as wasmCloud. Not only is contributing to open
source a great way to pay back a community powering the modern world, it is also a huge passion of
mine. Being able to help the development of such projects during paid worktime enables me to learn
so much on emerging technologies, and maybe help build the revolutionary tools of tomorrow.</p>
<p>So... wasmCloud!? I have been interested in WebAssembly ever since it promised to replace
JavaScript, a language I personally consider as extremely poorly designed (someone once told me it
was designed in three days, so no wonder there). While WebAssembly is very far from doing anything
close to replacing JavaScript in the browser, it has evolved into something else: an application
runtime and a potential replacement for containers.</p>
<h1 id="webassembly-as-a-platform-foundation">WebAssembly as a Platform Foundation</h1>
<p>Modern platforms nearly all build on top of containers as their foundational element to run
executable code. This is a logical evolution from Docker's meteoric growth, and the ecosystem that
grew around its open standards (such as the
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://opencontainers.org/">OCI - Open Container Initiative</a>). While containers provide a huge
step in terms of ease of use, standardization, and security compared to shipping raw artefacts to
virtual machines, as was the case before them, they do have some shortcomings.</p>
<p>First and foremost, containers are not composable. In part due to their flexibility, they do not
offer standard ways of expressing how the world should interact with them at runtime, or what they
rely on to perform their functionality. This means that containers are typically deployed as
REST-based microservices, where containers communicate with one another over a network using APIs
agreed upon outside of the container standards. This lack of standardization makes building reusable
components more challenging than it has to be. Moreover, each container essentially needs a server,
authentication, authorization, and more to run. This results in quite some waste in the compute
density of the platform, with lots of compute wasted on boilerplate.</p>
<p>Moreover, while containers are a huge step in the right direction in terms of security, they are not
quite as secure as most people are led to believe. Containers are "allow by default" constructs,
which take quite some work to properly harden.</p>
<p>Finally, due to how containers are typically built, their startup times are not that great. It is
not abnormal to see container start times in the dozens of seconds. This does not bother people very
much because containers are mostly used to run long running processes (since we need these REST APIs
everywhere). However, a large part of containers are mostly idle, waiting for some API request to
come in. If one considers that workloads could be called (and thus the process started) only when
needed, startup times over 100ms is considered slow.</p>
<p>This is where WebAssembly comes it. WebAssembly addresses these challenges. Composability is
addressed by the component model.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-the-component-model">WebAssembly: The Component Model</h2>
<p>The <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">component model</a> is a way that WebAssembly
modules can be built with metadata attached to them which describe their imports and exports based
on a rich type system. Moreover, they are composable such that a new component can be built from
existing components as long as the imports of one are satisfied by the exports of another. This
means that components can interact with one another via direct method/function calls, whose
specification is fully standardized. This interface specification is declared in a language known as
the WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT) language. An example of a WIT specification of a component
relying on a system clock can be seen below:</p>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #EBDBB2; background-color: #282828;"><code data-lang="wit"><span class="giallo-l"><span style="color: #FE8019;">package</span><span style="color: #FABD2F;"> wasi-example</span><span style="color: #8EC07C;">:</span><span style="color: #FABD2F;">clocks;</span></span>

<span class="giallo-l"><span style="color: #A89984;">}</span></span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WIT can be compared to the
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language">Interface Definition Language (IDL)</a>
from gRPC but for wasm components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This declaration says that the component relies on an interface <code>wall-clock</code> (it <code>import</code>s the
interface) which defines two functions: <code>now</code> and <code>resolution</code>. Both take no arguments and return a
<code>datetime</code> object consisting of a <code>seconds</code> and <code>nanoseconds</code> field. This component could then be
composed with any other component which exports this <code>wall-clock</code> interface.</p>
<p>If this were a container which would rely on accessing some API, we would need to read a
non-standardized documentation of the container image, and then read up on other containers to
ensure they provide APIs that match the ones called by the first container.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly component model can essentially be seen as a form of contract-based programming to
formalize interfaces between WebAssembly core modules.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-secure-by-default">WebAssembly: Secure by Default</h2>
<p>Whereas containers provide some form of security by namespacing processes and filesystems,
WebAssembly actually sandboxes modules such that they cannot affect one another, or the host they
run on. By default a WebAssembly module cannot perform any privileged action and needs to be granted
explicit permission. I will not dive deeper into the details of this or I might loose myself in a
rant on how software security in the modern day and age is abysmal.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-performance">WebAssembly: Performance</h2>
<p>WebAssembly's main goal is performance. This means that WebAssembly modules run fast, but also that
loading modules and starting them is much faster than containers. This has proven to be very useful
already, for instance in use cases such as serverless computing, where hyperscalers heavily rely on
WebAssembly as a runtime to reduce cold start times, and reduce the delay in function calls.</p>
<p>Considering the idea to avoid having long running servers providing REST APIs and move to raw
function calls on short running modules, having extremely short start times is imperative.</p>
<p>Alright, so we can see that WebAssembly can be a great choice for the foundation runtime of a
platform. So where are platforms leveraging this? Well, actually, quite some "platforms" leverage
this idea already. For instance, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://www.spinkube.dev/">SpinKube</a> does exactly this, enabling
to run WebAssembly functions on Kubernetes. However, you still interact with these functions via a
REST call. Another example is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://www.kubewarden.io/">Kubewarden</a>, leveraging WebAssembly
modules to evaluate policies. While some might argue that this is not a platform, Kubewarden
provides a runtime for arbitrary programs, including their scheduling and deployment. Sounds like a
platform to me.</p>
<p>Finally: wasmCloud! wasmCloud is probably what people would consider the closest to a full blown
platform to run WebAssembly modules. In other words, what Kubernetes is to containers, wasmCloud is
to WebAssembly components. It provides a way to deploy, schedule, link, and lifecycle WebAssembly
components on a distributed platform.</p>
<h1 id="wasmcloud-architecture">wasmCloud Architecture</h1>
<p>Let us look at the wasmCloud architecture a little.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This section will contain quite a few comparisons to Kubernetes concepts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally, the wasmCloud architecture can be seen as quite similar to the Kubernetes architecture,
with the difference being that wasmCloud does not provide as much flexibility in swapping out
building blocks as Kubernetes does. This makes sense as it is a more nascent technology and is
currently more opinionated.</p>
<p>As a reference, here is the diagram wasmCloud uses to provide an overview of the platform:</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <div class="zoomable-image-container">
      <img src="/img/wasmcloud/platform-overview.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>
    
      <figcaption class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><p>An overview of the wasmCloud platform</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>As one can see, the architecture is essentially a set of hosts connected via a so called "lattice".
Thus, the architecture distributes the runtime over a set of compute instances in order to achieve
resilience against hardware/compute failures. The principle is identical to the one from Kubernetes,
providing a cluster in order to be able to quickly shift payloads on the platform to different nodes
in case of node failures.</p>
<h2 id="hosts">Hosts</h2>
<p>wasmCloud hosts are the foundation of the compute platform that is provided. They are the equivalent
of Kubernetes nodes and provide a WebAssembly runtime for components to run on. Just as with
Kubernetes nodes, application developers will rarely need to worry about the hosts other than for
deployment affinities and the like.</p>
<p>In practice, hosts can be anything from a virtual machine, an IoT device, or even a pod running on
Kubernetes. In fact, hosting wasmCloud on Kubernetes is a relatively straight forward way to get
started with the technology, providing wasmCloud as an application runtime, while providing services
via Kubernetes.</p>
<h2 id="lattice">Lattice</h2>
<p>The wasmCloud lattice is its networking layer. This can seem a bit strange when considering that
this a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://nats.io/">NATS</a> instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with NATS: it is an event streaming component similar to Kafka, but provides
additional features such as a key values store, an object store, and publish-subscribe
capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a NATS instance as the "networking layer" confused me quite a lot at first. However, one has
to remember that thanks to the component model, we no longer require HTTP/TCP network calls for our
components to interact with one another. Thus we don't necessarily need an IP to address a component
we want to reach. Of course NATS itself will require a physical network to run on in order to
distribute events to its different instances, but wasmCloud then only needs to use NATS.</p>
<p>Essentially, every component exposing a function becomes a subscriber to a queue for this function
on NATS. Other components can then call this function via wRPC (gRPC for WebAssembly) by publishing
a call to some subject. This is quite different from Kubernetes networking, where calls need to know
the location of the callee in the network. Using a subject-based addressing model simplifies
deployment and improves scaling and resilience.</p>
<p>As a user of wasmCloud, you do not need to worry about this though. How function calls are preformed
under the hood is abstracted away from the user.</p>
<p>This distributed networking aspect is one of the superpowers of wasmCloud, as one does not need to
worry about how to address a component on the platform. However, it can also introduce strange
behaviour in some cases. For instance, on Kubernetes, it's common sense that a HTTP call to a
different pod running on the cluster can fail. On wasmCloud however, if the interface we are calling
from a different component returns some type, we use the component like a raw function call in our
components code. What if that call fails, not because of the called component but due to a
networking issue? In the current implementation of wasmCloud this will lead to a panic in the
caller. As this is typically not the desired outcome, efforts are underway to design an adapted way
how the interfaces need to be designed to handle failures in the transport layer. On top of that,
function calls might change such that might avoid using NATS as a transport layer if the component
being called in on the same host and the caller.</p>
<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>This is where Kubernetes and wasmCloud start differing in their philosophy. Thanks to the
standardized way interfaces can be declared in the component model, one can describe an abstract
interface which provides some functionality, without providing an implementation. This is what
capabilities are. They are abstract interfaces that describe some useful functionality, such as
reading and writing to a key value store, or retrieving some sensitive information from a secured
environment. These capabilities are published on wasmCloud for applications to use.</p>
<p>An application developer can then write a component that makes use of that interface if he/she needs
that functionality. He/she does not need to worry about how this capability is implemented. He
relies on the "contract" provided by the capability.</p>
<p>In my opinion, while this is quite challenging to grasp initially, this is what makes wasmCloud so
promising. Having worked on many platforms in the past, the main challenge is always how additional
services can be provided on top of raw platforms such as Kubernetes in a way that makes then highly
standardized while easily consumable. In the current state of platform engineering, this quickly
becomes a question of good product management. Unfortunately, doing this correctly is surprisingly
difficult. Capabilities provide a technical solution to this, with the only limitation being
complete incompatibility with existing software.</p>
<h2 id="providers">Providers</h2>
<p>A provider is a specific implementation of a capability. For instance, taking the example of the
capability enabling the reading and writing to a key value store, a provider might implement this by
having a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://valkey.io/">ValKey</a> instance backing the capability. Another provider might
implement the very same capability using NATS, Redis, or even an in-memory key-value store.</p>
<p>Abstracting the provider away from the consumer via a capability enables the platform to swap
providers based on needs. Of course performing such a swap might be quite complex, for instance
involving a data migration from NATS to ValKey. However, the beauty is that the applications do not
require any changes as would be the case in traditional platforms.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the provider might run completely outside of wasmCloud itself. However,
wasmCloud also provides internal providers that are backed into the hosts themselves, providing
functionality such as logging or randomness.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>Components refer to the WebAssembly payload that contain your business logic. In the traditional
sense, this is your application. However, in wasmCloud lingo, an application is a set of interlinked
components including all information about what capabilities they require.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Applications are an abstraction enabling to declaratively define a combination of components,
capabilities, and providers together into a deployable unit. Applications are based on the
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer external" target="_blank" href="https://oam.dev/">open application model (OAM)</a> and should thus look quite familiar to people
working with Kubernetes. In terms of definition, they are similar to a Kubernetes Deployment,
describing not only the deployment unit (component or pod in the Kubernetes context), but also its
replication, affinities, links to capabilities, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that in wasmCloud v2, applications are re-worked to be much more closely
modelled after Kubernetes Deployments and ReplicaSets. Version 2 drops the idea of Applications
alltogether and uses <code>Workload</code>, <code>WorkloadReplicaSets</code>, and <code>WorkloadDeployments</code> objects. These
are also no longer linked to the OAM. In all likelihood we will write another blog post showcasing
the capabilities of composition provided by version 2 in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wadm">wadm</h2>
<p>The wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm) manages Applications. It can be seen as the
deployment controller from Kubernetes for wasmCloud Applications. It essentially orchestrates the
deployment of components, capabilities, their links, etc. on the platform. This construct will also
be dropped with wasmCloud version 2.</p>
<h1 id="verdict">Verdict</h1>
<p>With a decent understanding of the architecture we can now get an idea of the uses of wasmCloud in
the real world. While I have not yet run anything productive on wasmCloud, I have played with the
platform a lot over the past few months, and have come to really appreciate some of its innovative
ideas.</p>
<p>Thus, to summarise my experience: wasmCloud is a relatively new platform and provides interesting
new approaches to how inter-component communication can be modeled. On top of that, it does it while
building on open standards such as WebAssembly and the component model, such that the business logic
of your application remains portable. While these new concepts are very promising, wasmCloud still
suffers from a couple drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>For people unfamiliar with WebAssembly, it has a quite steep learning curve. This is highly
accentuated for people unfamiliar with existing platforms such as Kubernetes.</li>
<li>The set of supported providers and capabilities is extremely small to date. This will of course
grow as adoption increases, but currently early adopters will have to write their own providers
most of the time and will not be able to rely on third-party components.</li>
<li>As wasmCloud shifts more responsibility to the platform level, it will require a strong platform
team to operate this with low developer friction. This can be an issue as finding highly skilled
platform engineers is quite difficult at the moment. However, the team behind wasmCloud is focused
on making application delivery as frictionless as possible.</li>
<li>Finally, I am not sure I currently understand the security model wasmCloud uses to authenticate
and authorize calls between components. While I am not sure this is a drawback, it does not yet
feel as intuitive as Kubernetes simple yet relatively powerful RBAC. I will have to dive deeper
into this to have a final opinion on it though (another blog post might follow on this).</li>
