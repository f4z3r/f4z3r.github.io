# Policy Engines

- comparison with kyverno and gatekeeper

# Concepts

- admissionpolicies
- policy servers

## Policy Servers

## Audit Scanner

# Compilation

- WASM and the like

# Verdict

- Can get arbitrarily complex -> quick that wasm might be simpler to understand then CEL
  (contextAware)
- Increases complexity of the platform
