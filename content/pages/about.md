# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am f4z3r, a software engineer who spends 99% of his time optimising his setup to make it work 1%
faster. I am passionate about cloud native software and infrastructure, security tooling, and
various programming languages.

I work on a variety of projects in various roles, such as:
- I am a principal software architect at [ipt](https://ipt.ch/en/), working on various mandates.
- I try to contribute to open source, on projects such as [HashiCorp
  Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault), the Kubernetes ecosystem, and various others.
- I am the current maintainer of the
  [`gruvbox-material.nvim`](https://github.com/f4z3r/gruvbox-material.nvim) NeoVim plugin.
- I am the author of a couple Lua tools and libraries such as
  [`sofa`](https://github.com/f4z3r/sofa),
  [`luatext`](https://github.com/f4z3r/luatext),
  [`luatables`](https://github.com/f4z3r/luatables),
  and [`luakube`](https://github.com/f4z3r/luakube).
- I am hacking away on my [NixOS setup](https://github.com/f4z3r/nix).

I am currently very interested in Rust, Zig, and WASM as a runtime for serverless code on
Kubernetes. Moreover, I am trying to re-invent the wheel by building CLI libraries for LuaJIT, just
because...
