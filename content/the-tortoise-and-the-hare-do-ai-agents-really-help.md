Making my development workflow as fast as possible is a big passion of mine. From customizing my
development setup to get the last inkling of efficiency out of it, to thinking how to manage notes
and knowledge resources to access them as quickly as possible. With the sudden ubiquity of AI in
development tools, I came to wonder how AI could help me write code faster. Being a quite the
skeptic when it comes to AI actually generating code for me (using tools such as GitHub Copilot), I
came to investigate AI agents which specialise in code reviews. In this blog post I will share my
experience using such an agent on a real world case, where such agents shine, and where they are
severely lacking.

# My General Skepticism about AI
# Why try out an AI agent then?
- fast reviews, instant feedback, etc
# Why CodeRabbitAI - does this align with goals?
- free trial, integrates well with GitHub
# Starting Small
- how does it fare on a small PR
# Larger PR
- still small repo - unpopular language
- but actual feature being implemented
# PKIs
- dashboards, etc
# Verdict
- duplicate feature, does not understand code
- would I use it? -> yes, but only as add-on, not faster, but maybe better, does not replace actual
  review


# Writing
## Who do you want to read this?
Developers mostly, some engineering managers.
## What do they know about what you're planning to write?
 Potentially a lot on code generation, in all likelihood very little on review Agents.
## Why do they care about what you're planning to write?
It can potentially help them improve their own speed in development if they use the tools
correctly. Moreover it can help them avoid building "AI tech debt" by avoiding pitfalls.
## Why should they care about your perspective?
I have a lot of experience in SE, have played with such agents on a _real_ example, and spend a
lot of my own time reviewing code (know what a good review means).
## What do you want them to do differently or think about differently after reading your blog post?
- Not blindly trust AI generated code
- Use AI for reviewing content in a _smart_ way
